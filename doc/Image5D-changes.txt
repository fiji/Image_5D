released version 1.2.1: 20100917


changes in Image5D 1.2.0:
- Added a "Tiled" display mode, that displays all color channels on separate
  canvasses in the same window.
    * ROIs are shown in all channels. copy / paste and most tools from the
      ImageJ toolbar work in the channel canvasses.
- Added a Plugin to duplicate an Image5D.
- Changed ScrollbarWithLabel class. Inner Scrollbar is now hidden. Had to
  change SyncWindows for this.
    * Release SyncWindows v1.7 together with Image5D v1.2.0!
- Made Scrollbars for selecting ch/z/t non-focusable to have the same behaviour
  as in the ImageJ StackWindow (and avoid confusion of keyboard shortcuts and
  blinking on Windows)
- Enabled using the getInfo("image.subtitle") macro function for Image5Ds.
    * Fix provided by Sebastien Huart (Sebastien.Huart_AT_curie.fr)
- Added Mousewheel control of Channels and Frames (like the slice slider of the
  Stack Window)
    * Pressing shift while moving the wheel moves the frame
      ("shi-F-t as in Frame")
    * Pressing ctrl while moving the wheel moves the channel
      ("C-trl as in Channel")
- Adapted modifiers (Ctrl / Shift) of keyboard shortcuts for selecting the
  current channel, slice and frame to match the Mousewheel modifiers:
    * channel: ctrl-PageDown and PageUp or numpad 7 and 8
    * slice: PageDown and PageUp or numpad 4 and 5 (no modifier)
    * frame: shift-PageDown and PageUp or numpad 1 and 2
- The "Transfer Channel Settings" and the "Set Channel Display" plugins are now
  macro-recordable. (The old "Underscore" problem).
- Adapted the "Set_Position" Plugin to the new "Tiled" display mode.
- The values of all channels at the current cursor location are displayed in
  the statusbar in overlay and tiled mode.
- Image5Ds now display the slice labels in the info line.
- In the "Stack to Image5D" plugin, the default choice of dimension orders
  (ch/z/t) now conforms to the order in ImageJ.
- Fixed a bug causing that the Image5D returned by the "Stack to Image5D"
  plugin was not the current image.

changes in Image5D 1.1.7:
- The z-/t-/ch-changer (slider, or selector for the channel in overlay mode) is
  only displayd when the size of the respective dimension is >1.
- Image5Ds react smoother to resizing.
- The Image5D_stack_to_RGB plugin transfers the calibration of the Image5D to
  the resulting RGB stack.
    * This feature was proposed by Jerome Mutterer.
- The Hypervolume_Opener now ignores .roi-files and calculates the increments
  starting from the "start"-value (i.e. as one would expect).
    * This change was proposed by Jonathan Jackson.
- Added keyboard shortcuts for selecting the current channel, slice and frame:
    * channel: PageDown and PageUp or numpad 7 and 8
    * slice: shift-PageDown and PageUp or numpad 4 and 5
    * frame: ctrl-PageDown and PageUp or numpad 1 and 2
    * This feature was proposed by Michael Murray.
- Added a rudimentary "about" dialog that can be used to check the installed
  Image5D version.

started version 1.1.7: 20060826
finished version 1.1.7: 20061004


changes in Image5D 1.1.6:
- Put core Image5D classes into a package structure. Plugins are still in the
  top level, because ImageJ has to install them.
- Added a method int compareToVersion(String testVersion) that checks,
  whether the version of Image5D is higher/lower than or equal to some
  requested version.

started version 1.1.6: 20060520
finished version 1.1.6: 20060521
version not released, but sent to Patrick Pirrotte
finally released in September 2006


changes in Image5D 1.1.5:
- The HyperVolumeOpener copies the calibration across from the first image in a
  series
    * (Feature by Jonathan Jackson j.jackson@ucl.ac.uk)
- Fixed a bug in Open_Image5D, so that the pixel width, height, depth and frame
  interval are now read correctly.
    * (Bug reported by Erik Meijering)
- Added a button, which enables selecing the color of a channel by a Dialog
  with three sliders for RGB.
- The three-slider RGB-Dialog is also opened by double-clicking on the Color
  Palette of the color selector.
- Added Constructor Image5D(String title, ImageStack stack, int nChannels, int
  nSlices, int nFrames) to prepare virtual Image5Ds.
- Added the plugin "Virtual_Image5D_Opener" to open file series as Image5Ds
  from disk. I.e. just the currently displayed data is in RAM. Everything else
  is on disk.
- Added an option to the Transfer_Channel_Settings plugin to copy the
  DensityCalibrations from one Image5D to another Image5D.
- Corrected a bug that would cause an exception with the montage and z-project
  plugins when single frames were processed with output as Image5D selected.
- Recommendation: Erik Meijering updated his TransformJ, FeatureJ and RandomJ
  plugins to work with Image5Ds.
    * see http://www.imagescience.org/meijering/software.
    * In particular you can crop Image5Ds and enlarge them with TransformJ.

changes in Image5D 1.1.4:
- The Stack_to_Image5D plugin takes over the pixel width, height and depth from
  the ImageStack.
- Inherited ImagePlus.flush(). This fixed a memory leak.
- Added a Plugin to convert the current timeframe of an Image5D to an RGB stack
  using the current view settings ("Image5D_Stack_to_RGB").
- Added a Plugin to Convert an Image5D to an ImageStack ("Image5D_to_Stack").
- Modified the "RGB_to_Image5D" plugin so that Hypervolumes containing
  z- and t- information can be converted.
- Removed the selection of the last dimension from the "Stack_to_Image5D"
  plugin, because it was unnecessary.
- Added a Plugin to create a new Image5D ("New_Image5D").

- Added a Plugin to select the displayed channel/slice/timeframe and the
  display mode ("Set_Position").
- Added a Plugin to change the display state (display in overlay / as gray) of
  a channel ("Set_Channel_Display").
- Added a Plugin to change the labels of the channels of an Image5D
  ("Set_Channel_Labels").

started version 1.1.4 20051007
finished version 1.1.4 20051023


changes in Image5D 1.1.3:
- Speeded up display by a factor of at least two by caching.
- Added support of calibration functions.
- Added Saving and Loading of Image5Ds
    * Metadata contains (beyond the usual metadata for ImageJ stacks):
      + lookup tables
      + contrast and brightness values
      + calibration functions
- Added a Plugin to transfer the colormaps and channel labels of one open
  Image5D to another one ("Transfer_Channel_Settings").
- Added a Plugin to make z-Projections of Image5Ds ("Z_Project")
- Added a Plugin to make montages of Image5Ds ("Make_Montage")
- Removed class Calibration5D (was superfluos)

started version 1.1.3 20050701
finished version 1.1.3 20051003


changes in Image5D 1.1.2:
- Fixed a bug in the setStack() method, that led to incorrect cooperation with
  e.g. Erik Meijering's TransformJ plugins.


changes in Image5D 1.1.1:
- Fixed a bug in HyperVolume Opener (and hence the "Open Series as Image5D"
  plugin) that could lead to a wrong datastack size when a directory contains
  several Hypervolumes.


changes in Image5D 1.1:
- Overwrote getImageStack() to return an ImageStack (not an Object[]). In the
  end this will make it possible to save Image5Ds.
- Added the method "public String getI5DMetaData()" to return Image5D specific
  metadata for saving. Currently an empty string is returned.
- Checking ImageJ version in Stack_to_Image5D and RGB_to_Image5D plugins.


changes in Image5D 1.0.1:
- Included the Hypervolume_Opener Plugin into Image5D. The Hypervolume_Opener
  is called from the Open_Stack_As_Image5D plugin
- The Hypervolume_Opener uses Windows XP style file sorting, i.e. digits
  appearing in the filename are treated as numbers and sorted accordingly. This
  works nicely with filenames of the style name-<ch>-<z>-<t>.tif even if the
  numbers <ch>... don't have leading zeros.
